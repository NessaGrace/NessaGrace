Hi! I'm Vanessa. Here's a little about me:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing an R Shiny app to predict pharmaceutical concentrations in wastewater influent and along the direct potable water reuse treatment train.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data mining techniques and soon will be learning about wastewater treatment process models.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on multi-regional studies to predict pharmaceutical occurrence.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with translating my model into a user-friendly R Shiny app.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about water chemistry, microbiology, pharmaceuticals in the environment, wastewater-based surveillance, and environmental justice.
